A simple fullstack app for TTP round 2.

API call to IEX, back-end will contain user data (user info and transactions).
Front-end built on React, back-end will be built on Node/Express/PostgreSQL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

note: time is now 4:44PM and not looking like code will be finished.
should not have spent time trying to encrypt user data with bcrypt to finish a basic MVP with working user model.
did not even get to making API calls.
apiservices.js (api.post functions) need work.
CSS isn't started.


Apologies for wasted time. Remember to wash your hands and eyes because this code may cause eye irritation.
